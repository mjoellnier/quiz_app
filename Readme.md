# Review the basics Sunday - #RTBS

This is my way of reviewing the basics (more or less) each sunday. In a world filled with NPM packages, ReactJS and all this fancy stuff someone can loose touch with the basic knowledge. At least I'm fearing to do so - so I created this handle #RTBS to create small projects to review the basics. Follow my journey via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coding_max) and add your own #RTBS story :)
